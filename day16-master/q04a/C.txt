Flushing
When you read from a file,
your program will not continue until the read operation finishes.
This is not exactly the case with writing operations.
When you execute one of the write() suite of methods,
this only puts the information in some structure of the operating system.
This may or may not be put immediately on disk,
depending in different factors.
